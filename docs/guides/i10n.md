# Internationalization

The root level `l10n.yaml` file is created automatically when the localization dependencies are added.
This file is used to configure the location of the project `arb` files, etc.

Strings in the `arb` files are compiled to the `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n` directory on `flutter run`.
They can also be force generated using `flutter gen-l10n`.

The supported languages and localization delegates are autogenerated from the `arb` files and part of the generated `gen_l10n` package.
